Hossain:
i dont like the certificate card in "Certifications.tsx". you should remove from the card  :
  1. issued , 
  2. description ( show only when hover )
and make the image larger because in the case of showing a certificate card 
it is different from project card or blog card , the image and title should explain all information but anyways show description when user hover
